# Turborepo starter

This is the repository to the corresponding medium article.

## Using this example

Clone the tutorial to your machine and run the following commands in the root of the project:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `my-app-1`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `my-app-2`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a component library shared by both `my-app-1` and `my-app-2` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `tailwindconfig`: `tailwind` is used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
